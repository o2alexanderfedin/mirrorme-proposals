## Executive Summary

Standardizing equipment and studio build-out across 50-100 MirrorMe franchise locations requires establishing a comprehensive supply chain for photography equipment, technology hardware, studio fixtures, and construction services. Total investment per location ranges from $120,000-$180,000, broken down into: (1) photography equipment ($8,300-$12,500), (2) technology hardware ($3,500-$5,000), (3) studio build-out and construction ($80,000-$140,000), (4) furniture and fixtures ($8,000-$12,000), and (5) initial inventory and supplies ($2,000-$3,500).

The franchisor should act as the primary equipment supplier for photography and technology hardware, purchasing in bulk from B&H Photo, Adorama, Canon, and other approved vendors at 15-25% discounts, then reselling to franchisees at cost + 10-15% markup. This ensures standardization, quality control, and generates ancillary revenue ($15,000-$25,000 margin per location). For studio build-out, franchisor should maintain a network of pre-approved regional contractors while allowing franchisees to source locally with franchisor approval to balance quality control with cost optimization.

Equipment maintenance contracts ($150-$300/month per location) and replacement reserves ($200-$400/month) ensure long-term operational reliability.

### 1.3 Franchisor as Equipment Supplier (Recommended Model)

**How It Works**:

1. **Franchisor bulk purchase**: Order 20-30 equipment kits upfront (or as needed per franchisee)
2. **Inventory management**: Store equipment at franchisor HQ or third-party warehouse
3. **Quality control**: Inspect and test each equipment kit before shipping to franchisee
4. **Resale to franchisee**: Invoice franchisee at cost + 10-15% markup
5. **Delivery**: Ship directly to franchisee's studio location

**Pricing Example (Package A - Standard)**:

| Cost Component | Amount | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Franchisor cost (bulk pricing) | $5,649 | 15% discount from suppliers |
| Shipping to franchisor | $100 | Bulk shipment amortized |
| Inspection & testing | $50 | Franchisor labor |
| **Total franchisor cost** | **$5,799** | |
| Markup (12%) | $696 | Ancillary revenue |
| Shipping to franchisee | $150 | Individual shipment |
| **Franchisee price** | **$6,645** | Still 4% below retail ($6,395) |
| **Franchisor profit** | **$696** | Per equipment kit |

**Benefits to Franchisor**:
- Ancillary revenue: $696 × 50 locations = $34,800 total
- Quality control: Ensure no counterfeit or defective equipment
- Standardization: Guarantee all locations have identical equipment
- Support simplification: Know exactly what equipment each location has

**Benefits to Franchisee**:
- One-stop shop: Order everything from franchisor (no hunting for suppliers)
- Pre-tested: Equipment arrives tested and ready to use
- Lower risk: Franchisor vouches for equipment quality
- Financing available: Franchisor can offer payment plans (see Section 1.5)

### 1.4 Alternative: Approved Vendor List (Lower-Touch Model)

If franchisor doesn't want to manage equipment inventory, provide franchisees with:

**Approved Vendor List**:
- B&H Photo Video (account number: MIRRORME2024)
- Adorama (business account: MirrorMe Franchise)
- Canon Direct (corporate account: MirrorMe Franchise Systems)

**Exact Equipment Specifications**:
- SKU numbers for every item
- Quantity required
- Acceptable substitutions (if primary item unavailable)

**Franchisee Responsibilities**:
- Purchase equipment directly from approved vendors
- Submit proof of purchase to franchisor (invoices)
- Franchisor inspects equipment during on-site training

**Tradeoff**:
- **Pros**: No inventory management for franchisor; no capital tied up
- **Cons**: Risk of franchisee buying wrong items; no quality control; franchisee may overpay (no bulk discount)

### 1.5 Equipment Financing Options

**In-House Financing** (Franchisor-Provided):

If franchisor has sufficient capital:
- **Terms**: 20% down, 36-month installment loan at 6-8% APR
- **Example**: Package A ($6,645)
  - Down payment: $1,329 (20%)
  - Financed: $5,316
  - Monthly payment: $163-$171 (at 6-8% APR)

**Third-Party Financing** (Equipment Lender):

Partner with franchise lender:
- **FranFund**: Franchise-specific financing
- **Benetrends**: Equipment and working capital loans
- **Bank of America Franchise Lending**: Equipment loans 5-7 years
- **Typical terms**: 10-20% down, 5-7% APR, 36-60 months

**Lease Option**:

Lease equipment through third-party lessor:
- **Monthly lease payment**: $250-$350 for 36 months
- **End of lease**: Franchisee owns equipment (buyout: $1)
- **Pros**: Lower monthly cost; preserve working capital
- **Cons**: Higher total cost (due to interest); franchisor doesn't retain ownership

- Total: $100,000-$140,000

**Smaller 600 sq ft Studio** (smaller market):
- Cost per sq ft: $100-$140
- Total: $60,000-$84,000

### 3.3 Regional Cost Variations

Build-out costs vary significantly by region:

| Region | Cost Multiplier | Example (800 sq ft) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **San Francisco, NYC, LA** | 1.3-1.5× | $104,000-$168,000 |
| **Chicago, Boston, Seattle** | 1.1-1.3× | $88,000-$146,000 |
| **Denver, Austin, Nashville** | 1.0-1.1× | $80,000-$123,000 |
| **Atlanta, Phoenix, Dallas** | 0.9-1.0× | $72,000-$112,000 |
| **Midwest (Indianapolis, etc.)** | 0.8-0.9× | $64,000-$101,000 |
| **Rural/Small Markets** | 0.7-0.8× | $56,000-$90,000 |

**Labor Cost Drivers**:
- Union labor requirements (CA, NY, IL): +20-30%
- Permitting complexity (SF, NYC): +$5,000-$15,000
- Cost of living (higher wages in expensive cities)

### 3.4 Landlord Tenant Improvement (TI) Allowance

Most commercial landlords provide **tenant improvement allowances** to attract tenants:

**Typical TI Allowance**: $20-$50 per sq ft

**Example Negotiation** (800 sq ft studio):
- Build-out cost: $90,000
- Landlord TI allowance: $30/sq ft × 800 = $24,000
- **Franchisee out-of-pocket**: $66,000

**Best Practices**:
- Negotiate TI allowance before signing lease
- Ensure TI allowance covers "soft costs" (permits, design) not just "hard costs" (construction)
- Request higher TI in exchange for longer lease term (10 years vs. 5 years)

### 3.5 Contractor Sourcing Strategy

**Option 1: Franchisor-Approved Contractor Network (Recommended)**

Franchisor maintains list of pre-approved regional contractors:

**Benefits**:
- Quality assurance: Contractors vetted by franchisor
- Pricing consistency: Negotiate standard pricing with contractors
- Faster builds: Contractors familiar with MirrorMe design standards
- Streamlined approval: Franchisor pre-approves contractors; franchisee just selects from list

**How to Build Contractor Network**:
1. **Pilot phase**: Work with 3-5 contractors for pilot locations; evaluate quality, timeliness, cost
2. **Regional expansion**: As franchise expands, recruit contractors in each region
3. **Contractor training**: Provide contractors with MirrorMe design standards, brand guidelines
4. **Preferred pricing**: Negotiate volume pricing (e.g., "Build 5 studios, get 10% discount")

**Compensation Model**:
- Franchisor does NOT mark up contractor services (avoid legal issues)
- Franchisor may charge franchisee **design fee** ($2,500-$5,000) for studio layout plans and project management

**Option 2: Franchisee Sources Contractor (Lower-Touch Model)**

Franchisee finds local contractor; franchisor approves:

**Process**:
1. Franchisee solicits bids from 3+ local contractors
2. Franchisee submits bids to franchisor for review
3. Franchisor approves contractor based on: credentials, portfolio, pricing
4. Franchisee signs contract with contractor
5. Franchisor monitors build progress (site visits or photo updates)

**Tradeoff**:
- **Pros**: Franchisee may find lower-cost local contractor; no contractor network management for franchisor
- **Cons**: Quality variability; longer approval process; risk of non-compliant build

**Recommendation**: **Option 1** (Franchisor-Approved Network) for first 30-50 locations to ensure quality. Transition to **Option 2** once design standards proven and franchise system mature.

   - Bulk order (50+ units): $4,000-$5,000 per mirror wall (15-20% discount)
   - **Pros**: Guaranteed consistency across all locations; quality control
   - **Cons**: Higher upfront capital for franchisor; shipping logistics

**Recommendation**: **Franchisor-supplied** for first 20-30 locations to ensure brand consistency. Transition to **approved local fabricator** network as system scales (same specs, franchisor approves each installation).

## 7. Franchisor Equipment Revenue Model

### 7.1 Ancillary Revenue from Equipment Sales

**Revenue per Location** (assuming franchisor supplies all equipment):

| Equipment | Franchisor Cost | Resale to Franchisee | Margin | Margin % |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------|----------|
| Photography Equipment | $5,649 | $6,645 | $996 | 17.6% |
| Technology Hardware | $1,900 | $2,185 | $285 | 15.0% |
| Furniture (if supplied) | $9,000 | $10,500 | $1,500 | 16.7% |
| Initial Inventory | $1,800 | $2,000 | $200 | 11.1% |
| **TOTAL PER LOCATION** | **$18,349** | **$21,330** | **$2,981** | **16.2%** |

**System-Wide Revenue** (50 locations):
- Total margin: $2,981 × 50 = **$149,050**
- Covers: Franchisor staff time, inventory management, warranty support

**Capital Requirement**:
- To stock 50 equipment kits: $18,349 × 50 = **$917,450**
- Phased approach: Stock 10 kits initially ($183,490); replenish as sold

### 7.2 Alternative: Third-Party Financing Partnership

If franchisor doesn't have $900K+ capital for inventory, partner with equipment finance company:

**Model**:
1. Franchisee selects equipment from franchisor
2. Franchisor invoices finance company (not franchisee)
3. Finance company pays franchisor immediately (100% of invoice)
4. Franchisee makes monthly payments to finance company (36-60 months)
5. Finance company earns interest; franchisor avoids capital tie-up

**Franchisor Benefits**:
- No inventory capital required
- Still controls equipment standardization
- Still earns margin on equipment sale

**Franchisee Benefits**:
- Preserve working capital (pay over time vs. lump sum)
- Affordable monthly payments

## 8. Equipment Maintenance & Warranties

### 8.1 Warranty Coverage

**Manufacturer Warranties**:

| Equipment | Manufacturer Warranty | Extended Warranty Available | Cost |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------|------|
| **Canon Camera & Lens** | 1 year parts & labor | Canon CarePAK Plus (3 years) | $300-$500 |
| **Godox Lighting** | 1 year parts & labor | Extended warranty (2 years) | $100-$150 |
| **Intel NUC** | 3 years parts & labor | N/A (3 years sufficient) | Included |
| **Synology NAS** | 2 years parts & labor | Extended warranty (3 years) | $80-$120 |

**Franchisor Recommendation**: Require all franchisees to purchase **extended warranties** for cameras and lighting (critical equipment). Cost: $400-$650 per location; provides peace of mind and reduces downtime.

### 8.2 Maintenance Contracts

**Annual Professional Servicing**:

- **Camera & lens**: Annual cleaning and calibration by authorized Canon service center ($200-$300)
- **Lighting**: Annual inspection and cleaning ($100-$150)
- **NAS**: Annual health check and firmware updates (DIY or $100 service call)

**Total Annual Maintenance**: $400-$550

**Optional: Franchisor-Managed Maintenance Program**:

Franchisor contracts with national service providers (e.g., Canon Professional Services) and invoices franchisees:

- **Monthly fee**: $50-$75 per location
- **Covers**: Annual servicing, priority repair service, loaner equipment during repairs
- **Franchisor benefits**: Simplified management; ensures all locations maintain equipment properly

### 8.3 Equipment Replacement Lifecycle

**Typical Replacement Schedules**:

| Equipment | Initial Cost | Useful Life | Annual Depreciation | Replacement Reserve |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Camera Body** | $2,500 | 5 years | $500/year | $42/month |
| **Lens** | $2,000 | 7 years | $286/year | $24/month |
| **Lighting (2x)** | $600 | 7 years | $86/year | $7/month |
| **NUC** | $700 | 4 years | $175/year | $15/month |
| **Furniture** | $11,000 | 10 years | $1,100/year | $92/month |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$2,147/year** | **$180/month** |

**Recommendation**: Franchisee contributes $200/month to equipment replacement reserve (held in separate bank account). Ensures funds available for equipment upgrades without disrupting cash flow.

## 9. Recommendations

### 9.1 Supply Chain Strategy

**Years 1-2 (Pilot Phase, 10-20 Locations)**:

- **Franchisor as equipment supplier**: Purchase and resell all photography and technology equipment
- **Franchisor-approved contractors**: Maintain network of 3-5 general contractors for build-outs
- **Branded mirror wall**: Franchisor-supplied (ensure consistency)
- **Furniture**: Provide approved vendor list (IKEA Business, commercial furniture suppliers)

**Years 3-5 (Growth Phase, 50+ Locations)**:

- **Franchisor as equipment supplier**: Continue for critical items (camera, lighting, NUC)
- **Approved vendor list**: Allow franchisees to purchase non-critical items (furniture, office supplies) from approved vendors for cost savings
- **Regional contractor network**: Expand to 10-15 contractors covering all major US regions
- **Bulk purchasing program**: Negotiate enterprise pricing with Canon, Godox for franchise system-wide discounts

### 9.2 Quality Assurance Process

**Pre-Opening Inspection** (before franchise opens):

1. **Equipment inspection**: Franchisor rep visits location; tests all equipment
2. **Build-out inspection**: Verify studio layout matches brand standards; photograph for documentation
3. **Technology setup**: Ensure NUC, NAS, networking configured correctly; test upload to cloud
4. **Final approval**: Franchisor issues "Certificate of Compliance" before grand opening

**Ongoing Audits** (annual or biannual):

- Field representative visits location
- Complete equipment checklist: Functioning? Clean? Properly maintained?
- Review studio appearance: Paint touch-up needed? Furniture worn? Mirror wall clean?
- Issue corrective action plan if deficiencies found

### 9.3 Cost Optimization Opportunities

1. **Negotiate TI allowances aggressively**: Target $30-$50/sq ft from landlords (reduces franchisee build-out costs by $24,000-$40,000)
2. **Volume discounts**: Renegotiate supplier pricing at 25, 50, 100 locations
3. **Refurbished equipment**: For budget-conscious franchisees, offer Canon refurbished cameras (20-30% savings with same warranty)
4. **Standardized design**: Avoid custom millwork beyond branded mirror wall (use IKEA/stock furniture to reduce costs)
