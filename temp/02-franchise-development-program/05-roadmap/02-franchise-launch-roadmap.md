# Franchise Launch Roadmap (Months 10-18)

**Sprint**: 02 - Franchise Development & Multi-Location Expansion
**Task**: 05 - Implementation Roadmap
**Date**: 2025-11-17
**Author**: roadmap-planner

## Executive Summary

The franchise launch phase (Months 10-18) transforms MirrorMe from a **multi-unit operator** into a **franchisor**. This 9-month period focuses on three critical objectives: **franchisee recruitment** (generating 50-100 qualified leads), **franchise sales** (converting 3-5 franchisees), and **franchise openings** (successfully launching first locations with full support).

Investment required: **$75K-$150K** (marketing, broker commissions, opening support).<br/>
Expected outcomes: **3-5 signed franchise agreements**, **1-3 locations opened**, **$75K-$125K in franchise fees collected**.

**Critical Success Factor**: First franchisee opening must be **flawless** - sets tone for entire system, generates testimonials, and proves replicability to future prospects. Under-promise and over-deliver on support.

## Key Milestones

- **Month 10**: Franchise recruitment launch, first 20 leads generated
- **Month 12**: First franchise agreement signed (validation of sales process)
- **Month 15**: First franchisee training completed, build-out underway
- **Month 18**: First franchise location opens, 3-5 total agreements signed
- **Go/No-Go Decision (Month 18)**: Proceed to aggressive growth if first openings achieve 70%+ of projections

| **Month 13** | 60-90 | 25-35 | 1 (5 attendees) | 1 | 2 |
| **Month 14** | 60-90 | 25-35 | 1 (5 attendees) | 1 | 3 |
| **Month 15** | 60-90 | 25-35 | 1 (5 attendees) | 0 | 3 |

| **TOTAL** | **500-730** | **200-285** | **8 (40 attendees)** | **5** | **5** |

**Conversion Rates**:
- Inquiry → Qualified: 40%
- Qualified → Discovery Day: 14% (40 attendees / 285 qualified)
- Discovery Day → Signing: 13% (5 signed / 40 attendees)
- **Overall Inquiry → Signing**: 0.7% (5 / 730 leads)

**Note**: Industry benchmark is 2-4% inquiry-to-signing. Lower rate here reflects first-year franchise launch (brand awareness building, proof of concept). Expected to improve to 2-3% by Year 2.

### Opening Timeline (First 5 Franchisees)

| Franchisee | Signed | Site Selection | Build-Out | Training | Grand Opening | Revenue (Month 1) |

**Key Insight**: 4-5 month lag between signing and opening (site selection, build-out, training). First opening in Month 17 (7 months after franchise sales launch).

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Sales Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Slow lead generation** (< 50 leads/month) | Medium (40%) | High - delays sales timeline | Increase digital ad spend by 50%, add 2-3 additional brokers, attend extra trade show |
| **Low discovery day conversion** (< 30%) | Medium (35%) | High - insufficient sales | Improve discovery day experience (better demos, franchisee testimonials), extend FDD review period, offer financing assistance |
| **Franchisee financing rejections** (SBA loan denials) | Medium (30%) | Medium - qualified prospects can't proceed | Partner with franchise-specific lenders (ApplePie Capital, Benetrends), offer franchisor financing (5-10% down, 5-year note) |
| **Competitor undercutting** (lower franchise fees) | Low (20%) | Medium - price pressure | Emphasize value (technology, support, brand), target quality over quantity, validate ROI with Item 19 data |

### Opening Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **First franchisee opening failure** (< 50% of projections) | Medium (30%) | **Critical** - kills momentum, scares prospects | Over-invest in first opening support (3x normal field visits), choose ideal market (proven demographics), provide extra marketing budget ($5K-$10K grant) |
| **Build-out delays** (> 90 days) | High (50%) | Medium - frustrated franchisees, delayed revenue | Pre-approve contractors (preferred vendor list), provide detailed build-out specs, weekly project management check-ins |
| **Staffing challenges** (can't hire quality photographers) | Medium (40%) | Medium - poor customer experience, low ratings | Provide recruitment training, expand hiring to gig workers (Thumbtack, Upwork), offer franchisor-led recruitment support |
| **Technology failures** (cloud editing downtime) | Low (15%) | High - service disruption, refunds | Invest in 99.9% uptime SLA (redundant servers, 24/7 monitoring), provide manual editing backup process, incident response plan (< 1 hour resolution) |

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Phase 2 budget overrun** (> 150% of plan) | Medium (40%) | Medium - cash flow strain | Secure $200K line of credit (pre-approved), phase spending (delay non-critical items), negotiate payment terms with vendors (Net 60-90) |
| **Lower franchise fee revenue** (< 3 sales) | Medium (35%) | High - can't fund operations | Reduce personnel costs (part-time FDM, outsource lead gen), extend timeline (accept 12-month payback vs. 9-month), seek investor capital ($100K-$250K bridge loan) |
| **Franchisee failures** (< 6 months) | Low (10%) | **Critical** - legal liability, brand damage | Rigorous franchisee screening (financial + character), intensive opening support, early intervention if metrics decline (weekly calls, troubleshooting) |

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework (Month 18)

**Proceed to Aggressive Growth (Year 2: 8 new franchises) IF**:

✅ **Sales Performance**:
- 5+ franchise agreements signed
- 50+ qualified leads in pipeline
- 30%+ discovery day conversion rate (improving)

✅ **Opening Performance**:
- 2+ locations opened by Month 18
- First franchisee achieving 70%+ of flagship revenue (Month 3 post-opening)
- 4.5+ star average rating across all franchisee locations

✅ **Financial Performance**:
- $120K+ franchise fees collected (cash flow positive on franchise development operations)
- Royalty revenue: $10K+ (3 months from first openings)
- Break-even path visible (6-12 months)

✅ **Operational Readiness**:
- Operations manual refined based on franchisee feedback
- Technology platform stable (99%+ uptime, no critical bugs)
- Support team scaling plan in place (hire additional FDMs, field trainers)

**If ANY criteria not met**:
- **Slow growth mode** (Year 2: 3-5 new franchises vs. 8)
- **Address gaps systematically** (improve sales process, enhance support, stabilize operations)
- **Re-assess at Month 24** (allow one delay cycle before aggressive growth)
