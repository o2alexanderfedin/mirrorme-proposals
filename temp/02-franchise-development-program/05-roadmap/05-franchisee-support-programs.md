# Franchisee Support Programs

**Sprint**: 02 - Franchise Development & Multi-Location Expansion
**Task**: 05 - Implementation Roadmap
**Date**: 2025-11-17
**Author**: roadmap-planner

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive franchisee support is the **#1 driver of franchise system success** - directly impacting franchisee profitability, satisfaction, retention, and brand reputation. MirrorMe's support strategy encompasses **four lifecycle stages**: **pre-opening** (site selection to grand opening, 12-16 weeks), **opening** (first 90 days, intensive support), **growth** (months 4-24, scaling revenue), and **maturity** (years 2+, optimization and innovation).

**Support Investment**: $50K-$100K annually (Years 1-2) scaling to $400K-$700K annually (Year 5) as franchise count grows to 73+ locations.

**Expected Outcomes**: 95%+ franchisee retention rate, 8.5+/10 satisfaction score, 80%+ of franchises achieving profitability within 12 months.

**Critical Success Factor**: **Proactive support** (anticipate issues before franchisees struggle) vs. reactive support (respond only when problems arise). Proactive support costs 2-3x more but delivers 5-10x ROI in retention and brand reputation.

## Key Support Programs

- **Pre-Opening**: Site selection, build-out, training, grand opening (12-16 weeks)
- **Ongoing**: Monthly calls, quarterly business reviews, annual conference
- **Marketing**: National fund, co-op advertising, local SEO, social media templates
- **Technology**: Cloud editing platform, franchise portal, CRM, help desk
- **Performance Improvement**: Struggling franchisee intervention, best practices sharing

## Pre-Opening Support (Weeks 1-16)

### Site Selection & Real Estate (Weeks 1-6)

**Objective**: Help franchisee secure ideal location (demographics, visibility, rent) within 6 weeks of signing.

**Support Activities**:

| Week | Activity | Franchisor Resources | Deliverables |
|------|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Week 1** | Kick-off call (franchisee + CEO + real estate consultant) | 1-hour call, site selection manual (40 pages) | Territory map, demographic targets, site criteria |
| **Weeks 2-3** | Market research (demographics, competition, traffic patterns) | GIS mapping software, competitor analysis | 5-10 potential sites identified |
| **Week 4** | Site tours (franchisee + real estate consultant) | On-site support (1-2 days, travel expenses covered by franchisee) | Site evaluation scorecards (1-10 rating per site) |
| **Week 5** | Site selection (franchisee decision, franchisor approval) | Final approval call, lease review checklist | Top 2 sites selected, lease negotiation begins |
| **Week 6** | Lease negotiation & signing | Lease template review, attorney referral (if needed) | Lease signed (5-year term + 2x 5-year options) |

**Site Selection Criteria** (franchisor-approved):

- **Demographics**: Population 100K+ within 5-mile radius, median household income $60K+, 20K+ LinkedIn users locally
- **Visibility**: Ground-floor retail, street-facing entrance, signage-friendly zoning, 50+ car parking spaces nearby
- **Accessibility**: <5 minutes from major highway, public transit access (bus/train within 0.5 miles)
- **Competition**: No direct competitors (headshot studios) within 3-mile radius, complementary businesses nearby (real estate offices, corporate parks)
- **Rent**: $3K-$5K/month ($36-$60/sq ft annually), 800-1,200 sq ft, 3 months free rent for build-out
- **Lease Terms**: 5-year initial term, 2x 5-year renewal options, rent escalation <3% annually, assignment clause (franchisee can resell)

**Franchisor Rejection Reasons** (quality control):
- Demographics below criteria (too small population, low income)
- Rent above $5K/month (franchisee profitability risk)
- Lease term <5 years (insufficient time to recoup build-out investment)
- No signage rights (limits visibility, marketing effectiveness)

**Success Metrics**:
- 90%+ of franchisees secure lease within 6 weeks
- 95%+ of sites meet all criteria (demographics, rent, visibility)
- <5% of leases require re-negotiation (franchisor catches issues in review)

### Build-Out & Equipment (Weeks 7-14)

**Objective**: Complete build-out and equipment installation on-time and within budget ($60K-$80K).

**Support Activities**:

- **Approval Process**: Franchisee submits campaign plan (targeting, creative, budget) → franchisor approves → franchisee executes → franchisor reimburses 25-50%
- **Performance Requirement**: Campaign must generate 3x ROI (revenue vs. cost) for franchisor to reimburse

**Example**:
- Franchisee spends $2K on Facebook Ads (grand opening promotion)
- Campaign generates $8K revenue (100 bookings × $80 avg)
- ROI: 4x ($8K revenue / $2K cost)
- Franchisor reimburses $500-$1K (25-50% match) → Franchisee net cost $1K-$1.5K → Net ROI 5-8x

**Co-Op Budget** (franchisor allocation):
- **Year 2**: $10K-$20K total (13 franchises × $750-$1,500 avg match)
- **Year 3**: $30K-$60K total (28 franchises × $1K-$2K avg match)
- **Year 4**: $60K-$120K total (48 franchises × $1.25K-$2.5K avg match)
- **Year 5**: $100K-$200K total (73 franchises × $1.4K-$2.75K avg match)

**Co-Op ROI** (for franchisor):
- Franchisees spend $3M-$6M total on local marketing (Years 2-5)
- Franchisor subsidizes $200K-$400K (6-13% of franchisee spend)
- Incremental revenue: $15M-$30M system sales (5x ROI on co-op marketing vs. no subsidy)
- Franchisor royalty revenue: $900K-$2.1M (6-7% × $15M-$30M) → **4.5-8x ROI on co-op investment**

    L --> M["Franchisor Facilitates Exit (find buyer, negotiate price, transfer agreement)"]
```

**Intervention Tactics**:

| Issue | Root Cause | Franchisor Solution |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low Revenue** | Weak marketing, poor location, competition | Provide $2K-$5K emergency marketing budget (Facebook ads, partnerships), on-site marketing consultant (1 week), consider relocation support |
| **Negative Cash Flow** | High costs, overstaffing, poor pricing | Financial audit (line-by-line expense review), staffing optimization (reduce hours, cross-train), pricing increase (10-20%) |
| **Low Customer Satisfaction** | Poor photography, bad customer service, slow delivery | Re-training (send franchisee to flagship location, 1 week), quality control (franchisor reviews all photos for 30 days), hire better staff (recruitment support) |
| **Personal Issues** (franchisee burnout, health, family) | Franchisee overwhelmed, under-resourced | Hire general manager (franchisor subsidizes 50% of salary for 3 months), reduce workload (franchisor handles marketing, allows franchisee to focus on operations) |

**Intervention Success Rate Target**: 60-70% (6-7 out of 10 struggling franchisees recover to profitability within 90 days)

**If Intervention Fails**: Franchisor facilitates graceful exit (buyback franchisee assets at fair value, find new buyer, transfer agreement, protect brand reputation)

### Best Practices Sharing Program

**Objective**: Identify and replicate top-performer tactics across entire franchise system.

**Process**:

1. **Identify Best Practices** (quarterly):
   - Analyze franchisee performance data (revenue, profitability, customer satisfaction, marketing ROI)
   - Identify outliers (top 10-20% performers)
   - Interview top performers (30-60 min, understand what they're doing differently)

2. **Document Best Practices**:
   - **Case Studies** (5-10 pages): "How Franchisee A Achieved 50% Repeat Rate via Email Nurture Campaign"
   - **Playbooks** (10-20 pages): Step-by-step replication guide (email templates, targeting criteria, budget allocation)
   - **Video Tutorials** (10-20 min): Top performer demonstrates tactic (e.g., social media Reels strategy, corporate sales pitch)

3. **Share with All Franchisees**:
   - **Monthly Newsletter**: Feature 1-2 best practices per month (link to full case study/playbook)
   - **Quarterly Webinars**: Top performer presents tactic, Q&A with other franchisees
   - **Annual Conference**: Best practice workshops (hands-on training, break into small groups)

4. **Measure Adoption & Impact**:
   - Track how many franchisees implement best practice (20-40% adoption rate typical)
   - Measure revenue impact (franchisees who adopt see 10-20% revenue increase on average)
   - Iterate (refine playbook based on feedback, create v2.0)

**Best Practice Examples**:

| Best Practice | Originator | Result | Adoption Rate | Impact |
|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| **LinkedIn Cold Outreach Script** | Franchisee #3 (New York) | Landed 12 corporate clients, $45K annual revenue | 30% (10 franchisees) | +$15K avg revenue increase per franchisee |
| **Instagram Reels Strategy** | Franchisee #7 (Los Angeles) | 5,000 followers in 6 months, 20% of bookings from Instagram | 40% (15 franchisees) | +10K followers avg, +$8K revenue increase |
| **Referral Program (Refer Friend, Get $20)** | Franchisee #5 (Chicago) | 35% of customers refer someone, 50% repeat rate | 60% (25 franchisees) | +$12K avg revenue increase per franchisee |

**Best Practices ROI** (system-wide):
- Franchisor invests $20K-$40K/year (time to document, produce videos, facilitate sharing)
- Franchisees implement 3-5 best practices/year on average
- Revenue increase: $30K-$60K per franchisee (10-15% lift)
- **System-wide revenue increase**: $2M-$4M (73 franchises × $30K-$60K) → **50-100x ROI on best practices program**

| **Year 1** | 5 | 1.3 | $100K-$150K | $20K-$30K |
| **Year 2** | 13 | 2.5 | $200K-$300K | $15K-$23K |
