## Risk Management

### Growth Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Franchisee quality degradation** (too fast growth, poor screening) | High (60%) | Critical - brand damage, closures | Maintain qualification standards (net worth, experience), limit growth to absorption capacity (max 30 new/year), rigorous training |
| **Support team can't scale** (overwhelmed, poor franchisee service) | Medium (50%) | High - franchisee dissatisfaction | Hire regional directors proactively (before reaching capacity), invest in technology (self-service portal, AI chatbots) |
| **Market saturation** (too many franchises in same metro) | Medium (40%) | Medium - cannibalization, franchisee conflicts | Protected territories (5-mile radius or ZIP code exclusivity), density limits (max 10 franchises per 1M population) |
| **Economic downturn** (recession, corporate budget cuts) | Medium (35%) | High - revenue decline across system | Diversify revenue streams (B2B + consumer), offer recession-proof services (LinkedIn headshots, job seekers), adjust pricing |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Technology platform failure** (extended outage, data breach) | Low (15%) | Critical - franchisee revenue loss, legal liability | Invest in 99.9% uptime SLA, data encryption, regular security audits, cyber insurance ($2M-$5M policy) |
| **Franchisee lawsuits** (misrepresentation, FDD errors, territory disputes) | Medium (30%) | High - legal costs, regulatory scrutiny | Accurate FDD Item 19 (conservative projections), franchise attorney review (annual), franchisee advisory council (reduce conflicts) |
| **Key employee turnover** (CEO, regional directors) | Medium (40%) | Medium - operational disruption | Equity incentives (5-10% ownership for key team), succession planning, cross-training |

### Exit Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Lower-than-expected valuation** (market multiples compress) | Medium (40%) | Medium - $10M-$15M vs. $20M-$30M | Delay exit until market recovers, pursue multiple buyers (competitive bidding), emphasize growth trajectory |
| **Buyer due diligence uncovers issues** (franchisee complaints, financial irregularities) | Low (20%) | High - deal collapse or price reduction | Proactive compliance (annual FDD audits), financial transparency (audited statements), franchisee satisfaction surveys |
| **Earn-out disputes** (growth targets not met) | Medium (35%) | Medium - $2M-$5M at risk | Negotiate achievable earn-out metrics, maintain CEO involvement during transition, document baseline assumptions |
