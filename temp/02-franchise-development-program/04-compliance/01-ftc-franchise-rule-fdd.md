## Executive Summary

The Federal Trade Commission's Franchise Rule (16 CFR Part 436) establishes comprehensive disclosure requirements for franchisors operating in the United States. The cornerstone of franchise compliance is the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD), a standardized document containing 23 required items that must be provided to prospective franchisees at least 14 calendar days before any binding agreement is signed or payment is made.

For MirrorMe's franchise expansion, FDD preparation represents the most significant initial legal hurdle, with preparation costs ranging from $25,000-$75,000 and timeline requirements of 3-6 months. The FDD must be updated annually within 120 days of fiscal year-end (April 30 for calendar-year companies), with quarterly amendments required for material changes.

Non-compliance with the FTC Franchise Rule can result in severe penalties including contract rescission, monetary damages, substantial civil fines, and personal liability for franchisor owners. The 14-day disclosure waiting period is strictly enforced, and violations constitute unfair or deceptive practices under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

### Item 19: Financial Performance Representations (FPRs)

**Purpose:** Disclose historical financial performance of franchise or company-owned locations (optional but increasingly expected).

**Critical Importance:**
Item 19 is the most scrutinized section by prospective franchisees and regulators. Making false or unsubstantiated claims can result in FTC enforcement, rescission rights, and fraud claims.

**Two Options:**

**Option A: Make No FPR (Conservative Approach)**

Disclose required disclaimer:
> "We do not make any representations about a franchisee's future financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with the actual records of that outlet. If you receive any other financial performance information or projections of your future income, you should report it to the franchisor's management by contacting [name and contact info], the Federal Trade Commission, and the appropriate state regulatory agencies."

**Advantages:**
- Simpler FDD preparation (no substantiation required)
- Less liability exposure
- Flexibility in individual discussions with prospects

**Disadvantages:**
- Competitive disadvantage (70%+ of franchisors provide Item 19 data)
- Franchisees forced to make blind financial decisions
- Difficulty securing financing without performance data
- Perceived lack of transparency

**Option B: Make FPR (Recommended for Established Concepts)**

**Requirements:**
- Must have "reasonable basis" for all representations
- Written substantiation must be available to prospective franchisees upon request
- Must disclose:
  - Number and percentage of outlets achieving results
  - Time period data covers
  - Characteristics of outlets included (location, size, age, market)
  - Material assumptions underlying calculations

**Permitted FPR Formats:**

1. **Gross Sales/Revenue:**
   - Average, median, and range of gross sales
   - Most common and straightforward disclosure

2. **Expenses:**
   - Cost of goods sold as percentage of revenue
   - Operating expense categories and percentages
   - Cannot disclose profit without substantiation

3. **Profitability:**
   - Net income or EBITDA (requires audited financials from franchisees)
   - Most valuable to prospects but hardest to substantiate
   - Higher legal risk if inaccurate

4. **Operational Metrics:**
   - Average customers per day/month
   - Average transaction size
   - Customer retention rates
   - Allows prospects to calculate potential revenue

| Gross Revenue | $215,000 | $485,000 | $338,000 | $325,000 |
| Sessions Completed | 850 | 1,920 | 1,340 | 1,300 |
| Average Session Revenue | $245 | $275 | $258 | $260 |

| Occupancy (%) | 12% | 18% | 15% | 15% |
| Marketing (%) | 8% | 14% | 11% | 11% |

**Number and Percentage of Outlets Achieving Results:**
- 2 of 3 studios (67%) achieved gross revenue of $325,000 or more
- 3 of 3 studios (100%) achieved average session revenue of $245 or more

**Material Assumptions:**
- Data includes only company-owned studios in operation for full calendar year 2024
- Studios located in mid-size metropolitan markets (population 250,000-750,000)
- Revenue includes corporate headshots, team photography, and on-location services
- Expenses shown as percentage of gross revenue; actual costs vary by market
- Data does not include owner's salary, financing costs, or depreciation
- Your results may differ based on location, competition, management, and market conditions

**Required Cautionary Language:**
> "A NEW FRANCHISEE'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS STATED IN THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATION. YOUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING YOUR BUSINESS ABILITIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, COMPETITION, INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, LABOR AND SUPPLY COSTS, LEASE TERMS, AND THE LOCAL MARKET FOR THE SERVICES WE OFFER."

**Substantiation Requirements:**
- Maintain detailed financial records from all outlets included
- Retain data for 3+ years
- Provide substantiation documents to prospects upon request
- Update annually with current fiscal year data

**Oral Earnings Claims:**
Even if Item 19 includes FPR, franchisor and franchise brokers cannot make earnings claims beyond what's in Item 19. Violations include:

- "You'll recoup your investment in 18 months" (ROI projection not in Item 19)
- Showing pro forma financials with revenue figures not disclosed in Item 19

**MirrorMe Strategy:**
- **Years 1-2 of Franchising:** No FPR (insufficient franchisee data)
- **Year 3+:** Add FPR once 10+ franchises have 12+ months operating history
- **Interim:** Provide actual data for any company-owned studios with appropriate disclaimers

**Required Elements:**
- Two identical receipt pages (tear-out or separate)
- Franchisee signs and dates both receipts
- Franchisee keeps one copy; returns one to franchisor

>
> If [Franchisor] offers you a franchise, it must provide this disclosure document to you 14 calendar days before you sign a binding agreement with, or make a payment to, the franchisor or an affiliate in connection with the proposed franchise sale.
>
> [State-specific risk factors if applicable]
>
> If [Franchisor] does not deliver this disclosure document on time or if it contains a false or misleading statement, or a material omission, a violation of federal and state law may have occurred and should be reported to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580 and [state agency].
>
> Date of issuance: [Date]
>
> I received a disclosure document dated [Date] that included the following Exhibits: [List A-Z]
>
> Date: __________ Signature: ____________________"

**Compliance Best Practice:**
- Use certified mail or email with read receipt for delivery documentation
- Maintain receipt records for 3+ years
- Never accept payment or signed agreement without valid receipt in file
- Calculate 14-day waiting period carefully (excludes day of delivery and day of signing)

---

## The 14-Day Disclosure Waiting Period

### Federal Requirement

Under 16 CFR § 436.2(a), franchisors must provide the FDD to prospective franchisees:

**At least 14 calendar days before:**
1. The prospective franchisee signs any binding agreement with the franchisor or an affiliate, OR
2. The prospective franchisee makes any payment to the franchisor or an affiliate

### Calculation Method

**Important:** The 14-day count does NOT include:
- The day the FDD is provided
- The day the agreement is signed or payment is made

**Example:**
- FDD delivered: Monday, January 1
- Day 1 of waiting period: Tuesday, January 2
- Day 14 of waiting period: Monday, January 15
- Earliest signing/payment date: Tuesday, January 16

**Practical Reality:** This is effectively a 15-day waiting period.

### Delivery Methods

**Acceptable Delivery:**
- In-person delivery (document receipt)
- Certified mail (track delivery date)
- Overnight courier (FedEx, UPS with signature)
- Email (if prospect agrees + read receipt)
- Electronic delivery via secure portal (with access confirmation)

**Proof of Delivery Required:**
- Signed receipt (Item 23)
- Delivery confirmation documentation
- Timestamped email or portal access logs

### Violations and Consequences

**What Constitutes a Violation:**
- Providing FDD with less than 14 days before signing/payment
- Failing to provide FDD at all before signing/payment
- Providing materially incomplete or inaccurate FDD
- Backdating receipt pages to create false compliance

**Penalties for Violations:**

**Federal Trade Commission Enforcement:**
- Civil penalties up to $50,120 per violation (adjusted annually for inflation)
- Injunctive relief prohibiting franchisor from selling franchises
- Consumer redress and restitution orders
- Corrective advertising and disclosure requirements

**Franchisee Remedies:**
- Right to rescind franchise agreement (contract voidable)
- Refund of all fees and investment costs
- Damages for losses incurred
- Attorney fees and costs

**State-Level Enforcement:**
- Additional civil penalties under state franchise laws
- Administrative sanctions (suspension of registration)
- Criminal penalties in some states for willful violations

**Case Law Example:**
In FTC enforcement actions, franchisors have paid millions in settlements for FDD timing violations, including refunds to all franchisees who did not receive proper disclosures.

### Best Practices for Compliance

**Document Everything:**
- Maintain FDD delivery log with dates, delivery methods, and tracking numbers
- Scan all signed receipt pages immediately upon return
- Create franchisee file with delivery documentation before proceeding

**Build in Buffer:**
- Use 21-day waiting period instead of minimum 14 days
- Allows time for prospects to review, ask questions, and conduct due diligence
- Reduces appearance of high-pressure sales tactics

**Train Sales Staff:**
- Franchise brokers and sales representatives must understand 14-day rule
- No exceptions, no shortcuts
- Violation by broker/representative is franchisor's liability

**State-Specific Variations:**
Some states have different or additional waiting periods:
- **Michigan:** 10 business days (stricter than federal 14 calendar days)
- **Rhode Island:** 10 business days
- **New York:** No specific waiting period, but requires "reasonable time" for review

When state and federal requirements differ, **comply with the stricter requirement.**

### Quarterly Amendment Process

**Steps:**
1. Identify material change within 15 days of occurrence
2. Attorney prepares amendment (updated FDD pages or addendum)
3. File amendments with registration states
4. Distribute amended FDD to all prospective franchisees
5. Restart 14-day waiting period if changes affect pending sales

**Cost of Quarterly Amendment:**
- **Attorney Fees:** $2,000 - $7,500 (depending on complexity)
- **State Filing Fees:** $0 - $500 per state

- Breach of contract

**Remedies Available to Franchisees:**

## Critical Success Factors for FDD Compliance

### 1. Choose Experienced Franchise Counsel

**Not All Attorneys Understand Franchising:**
- General business attorneys lack franchise-specific expertise
- Corporate attorneys may not know FTC Franchise Rule nuances
- Real estate attorneys cannot prepare compliant FDDs

**Hire Franchise Specialist:**
- Member of ABA Forum on Franchising or International Franchise Association (IFA)
- Has prepared 20+ FDDs for franchisors
- Experienced with state registrations and examiner negotiations
- Familiar with franchise relationship laws

**Cost vs. Value:**
- Cheaper attorney may produce non-compliant FDD, triggering enforcement or lawsuits
- Experienced franchise counsel prevents costly mistakes and legal exposure

### 2. Be Truthful and Transparent

**Complete Disclosure:**
- Disclose all litigation, even if unfavorable
- Report all franchise failures and closures
- Provide accurate financial statements
- Do not exaggerate support or franchisee success

**The Temptation to Misrepresent:**
- Item 19 earnings claims that overstate typical results
- Omitting terminated franchisees from Item 20
- Downplaying litigation in Item 3
- Inflating support services in Item 11

**The Consequences:**
- FTC enforcement and state regulatory actions
- Franchisee rescission rights and lawsuits
- Reputational damage and loss of credibility
- Personal liability for franchisor owners

**Best Practice:** Treat FDD as transparent disclosure document, not marketing brochure.

### 3. Maintain Meticulous Records

**Compliance Documentation:**
- FDD delivery logs with dates and proof of delivery
- Signed receipt pages (Item 23) from every prospect
- Copies of all FDD versions used (annual updates, amendments)
- Financial substantiation for Item 19 (if FPRs made)
- Franchisee financial data for future Item 19 consideration

**Retention Period:**
- Maintain all FDD-related records for **minimum 3 years**
- Many attorneys recommend 5-7 years (statute of limitations for fraud claims)
- Electronic storage acceptable if secure and backed up

### 4. Train All Franchise Sellers

**Who Needs Training:**
- Internal franchise sales team
- Franchise brokers and third-party sellers
- Independent franchise sales organizations (ISOs)
- Executives who speak with prospective franchisees

**Training Topics:**
- 14-day disclosure waiting period (no exceptions)
- Prohibited earnings claims (only Item 19 allowed)
- FDD delivery procedures and documentation
- Answering prospect questions accurately
- When to involve attorney or escalate to management

**Broker Liability:**
Franchisors are liable for FDD violations by franchise brokers, even if brokers are independent contractors. Agreements with brokers must:
- Prohibit unauthorized earnings claims
- Require FDD delivery compliance
- Mandate training and certification before selling franchises
- Include indemnification for broker violations

### 5. Budget for Ongoing Compliance

**Franchising is Not "Set It and Forget It":**
- Annual FDD updates required every year (indefinitely)
- State renewals required every year (for all registered states)
- Quarterly amendments as material changes occur
- Legal consultation for system changes, disputes, regulatory questions

**Annual Compliance Budget (Established Franchisor):**
- Legal fees: $10,000 - $25,000
- Audited financials: $10,000 - $20,000
- State renewals: $3,500 - $5,500
- **Total: $23,500 - $50,500 per year**

**Do Not Underestimate:**
Cutting corners on legal compliance to save money is false economy. The cost of one enforcement action or franchisee lawsuit far exceeds annual compliance costs.

## Conclusion

The FTC Franchise Rule and FDD requirements represent the foundation of franchise legal compliance in the United States. For MirrorMe's franchise expansion strategy:

**Critical Takeaways:**

1. **FDD is Mandatory:** Cannot sell franchises without compliant FDD (except in limited relationship law exemption states)

2. **Preparation is Expensive and Time-Consuming:** Budget $75,000-$125,000 and 3-6 months for initial FDD development and state registrations

3. **14-Day Rule is Strictly Enforced:** Provide FDD at least 14 calendar days before any signing or payment—no exceptions

4. **Annual Updates are Required:** FDD must be updated within 120 days of fiscal year-end; cannot sell with stale FDD

5. **State Compliance Adds Complexity:** 13 registration states require pre-sale approval; state relationship laws modify franchise agreement terms

6. **Item 19 FPRs are Optional but Expected:** Consider adding financial performance representations once sufficient franchisee data is available (Year 3+)

7. **Violations Have Severe Consequences:** FTC enforcement, state penalties, franchisee lawsuits, rescission rights, and reputational damage

8. **Ongoing Legal Costs are Significant:** Budget $25,000-$50,000 annually for FDD updates, state renewals, and legal consultation

**Recommendations for MirrorMe:**

- **Engage experienced franchise attorney immediately** (critical success factor)
- **Budget $100,000-$125,000** for initial franchise legal development
- **Target 5-7 key states** for initial registrations (reduce to ~$30,000 initial state costs)
- **No Item 19 FPR in first FDD** (add in Year 3 when franchisee data available)
- **Build compliance culture** from day one (meticulous recordkeeping, transparent disclosures)

The FDD is not merely a legal formality—it is the blueprint for the franchisor-franchisee relationship and the foundation of a compliant, sustainable franchise system.
