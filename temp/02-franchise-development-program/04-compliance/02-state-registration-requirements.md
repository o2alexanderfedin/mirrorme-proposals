## Executive Summary

Franchise regulation in the United States operates on two levels: federal (FTC Franchise Rule) and state. While the FTC Franchise Rule applies nationwide, **13-14 states** require franchisors to register their Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) with state regulators before offering or selling franchises within their borders. These are known as **"registration states"** or **"pre-sale registration states."**

State registration adds significant time, cost, and complexity to franchise expansion:
- **Initial registration fees:** $250-$750 per state ($5,500+ for all registration states)
- **Legal costs for registration:** $20,000-$35,000 for all states
- **Examiner review process:** 30-90 days per state (can be concurrent)
- **Annual renewal requirements:** Every state requires yearly renewals within 90-120 days of fiscal year-end
- **State-specific FDD modifications:** Addenda required for each registered state

Beyond registration states, **7-8 additional states** require notice filings (simpler process without pre-approval), and **20+ states** have franchise relationship laws that impose substantive requirements on the franchisor-franchisee relationship regardless of registration status.

For MirrorMe's franchise expansion, strategic state selection is critical. Targeting 5-7 key markets initially (rather than all 13 registration states) can reduce legal costs by $15,000-$20,000 while accelerating time-to-market.

## Notice Filing States (Alternative to Registration)

### 7-8 States Require Notice Filing

Notice filing states require franchisors to submit FDD and pay filing fee, but **do not conduct pre-sale examiner review**. This creates faster, simpler compliance process.

**Notice Filing States:**

| State | Filing Fee | Review Process | Deadline |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Connecticut | $400 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| Florida | $200 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| Kentucky | $500 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| Nebraska | $100 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| North Carolina | $250 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| South Carolina | $100 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| Texas | $20 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |
| Utah | $100 | No examiner review | Annual renewal |

**Key Differences from Registration States:**

**Advantages:**
- **No examiner review:** File FDD and begin sales immediately (or within days)
- **Faster process:** 1-7 days vs. 30-120 days for registration states
- **Lower legal costs:** Minimal attorney involvement needed
- **Simplified annual updates:** File updated FDD without examiner review

**Disadvantages:**
- Still subject to FTC Franchise Rule (must have compliant FDD)
- Must file state-specific notices and pay fees
- Annual renewal still required

**MirrorMe Strategy:**

**Texas (High Priority):**
- Largest notice filing state (population 30 million)

- **Recommended:** File in Texas immediately upon FDD completion

**Florida (High Priority):**
- Second-largest notice filing state (population 22 million)
- $200 filing fee
- Strong franchise market
- **Recommended:** File in Florida for Southeast expansion

**Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina (Medium Priority):**
- Mid-size markets with moderate filing fees
- Consider filing if targeting specific regions

**Kentucky, Nebraska, Utah (Lower Priority):**
- Smaller markets
- File only if specific demand or expansion plan

**MirrorMe Advantage:** Can begin franchise sales in these states as soon as FDD is complete (no waiting for state registration).

---

## Franchise Relationship Laws (20+ States)

### What Are Relationship Laws?

Franchise relationship laws are **substantive regulations** that govern the franchisor-franchisee relationship, separate from registration/disclosure requirements. These laws typically:
- Restrict termination and non-renewal (require "good cause")
- Mandate minimum notice periods before termination
- Limit non-compete and post-termination restrictions
- Prohibit certain franchise agreement provisions
- Provide statutory damages and fee-shifting for violations

**Key Distinction:**
- **Registration laws:** Disclosure and filing requirements (what you must tell franchisees before sale)
- **Relationship laws:** Ongoing conduct requirements (how you must treat franchisees during relationship)

### States with Relationship Laws

**Strong Relationship Laws (Comprehensive Protections):**
- Arkansas
- California
- Connecticut
- Delaware
- Hawaii
- Illinois
- Indiana
- Iowa
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Mississippi
- Missouri
- Nebraska
- New Jersey
- South Dakota
- Virginia
- Washington
- Wisconsin

**Moderate Relationship Laws (Limited Protections):**
- Rhode Island (disclosure of good cause only)
- Indiana (certain protections)

### Common Relationship Law Provisions

**1. "Good Cause" Termination Requirement:**
Franchisor cannot terminate franchise without proving good cause, even if franchise agreement allows termination without cause.

**Good Cause Examples:**
- Material breach of franchise agreement
- Failure to pay royalties or fees
- Abandonment of franchise
- Criminal conduct affecting franchise
- Health or safety violations

**Not Good Cause:**
- Low sales or profitability (unless performance minimum specified)
- Franchisor wants to operate location
- Personal conflict with franchisee

**2. Notice and Cure Requirements:**
- **Termination Notice:** 30-180 days advance written notice (varies by state)
- **Opportunity to Cure:** Franchisee must be given reasonable time to fix breach (30-90 days)
- **Non-Renewal Notice:** 90-180 days before expiration (varies by state)

**3. Non-Compete Restrictions:**
Many states limit post-term non-compete clauses:
- California: Non-competes generally unenforceable (limited exceptions)
- North Dakota: Non-competes prohibited by state constitution
- Other states: Limit duration, geographic scope, or circumstances

**4. Franchise Agreement Modifications:**
Relationship laws may override franchise agreement provisions, requiring state-specific addenda.

**Example - Minnesota:**
Even if franchise agreement says:
- "Franchisor may terminate without cause upon 30 days' notice"
- Minnesota law requires: "Franchisor may terminate only for good cause with 90 days' notice and opportunity to cure"

**Minnesota law controls** for franchises located in Minnesota.

### Impact on MirrorMe Franchise Agreement

**Required State Addenda:**
Franchise agreement must include addenda for each relationship law state disclosing how state law modifies agreement terms.

**Example State Addendum Language:**

> **CALIFORNIA ADDENDUM**
>
> The following provisions supersede and override conflicting provisions of the Franchise Agreement:
>
> 1. **Termination:** Notwithstanding any provisions in the Franchise Agreement, California Business and Professions Code Section 20020 requires that Franchisor have "good cause" to terminate the Franchise Agreement.
>
> 2. **Non-Compete:** California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 prohibits post-term non-compete covenants except in limited circumstances involving sale of franchisee's business.
>
> 3. **Governing Law and Venue:** The Franchise Agreement shall be governed by California law for franchises located in California. Any litigation shall be conducted in California courts.

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Engage franchise attorney to prepare state addenda for all relationship law states
- Include addenda as exhibits to FDD (Item 22)
- Train franchise sales team to explain state-specific modifications
- Do not attempt to circumvent relationship laws (voidable and creates liability)

## State Examiner Review Process

### What to Expect

**1. Initial Filing:**
Submit complete application package:
- FDD (all 23 items)
- Franchise agreement and exhibits
- Audited financial statements
- State application form
- Filing fee
- State-specific addendum

**2. Examiner Assignment:**
State assigns franchise examiner to review application (typically 7-14 days after filing).

**3. First Deficiency Letter (20-45 days):**
Examiner reviews FDD and issues deficiency letter identifying:
- Missing or incomplete disclosures
- Requests for additional information
- Required revisions to franchise agreement or FDD language
- Substantiation requests (Item 19, litigation, financial statements)

**Typical Number of Deficiencies:**
- **New FDD (first-time franchisor):** 15-40 deficiencies
- **Experienced franchisor (established FDD):** 5-15 deficiencies
- **Minor vs. Major:** Most are minor language clarifications; 2-5 may be substantive

**4. Response to Deficiencies (14-30 days):**
Franchisor's attorney prepares response:
- Revise FDD language as requested
- Provide additional documentation
- Explain why certain requests cannot be accommodated (rare)

**5. Second (and Sometimes Third) Deficiency Letter:**
Examiner reviews response and may issue additional comments. Process repeats until all issues resolved.

**6. Effective Date:**
Once examiner approves application, state issues **effective date**. Franchisor can begin offering/selling franchises in that state.

## NASAA Electronic Filing System (FRED)

**FRED Participating States (7):**
- Illinois
- Indiana
- Maryland
- Minnesota
- North Dakota

- Virginia

**Advantages:**
- **Single submission:** Upload FDD once for multiple states
- **Concurrent review:** All FRED states review simultaneously (faster than sequential)
- **Centralized communication:** Receive examiner comments through FRED platform
- **Reduced administrative burden:** One system instead of 7 separate portals

**Fees:**
- **New Registration:** $100 system fee + state filing fees
- **Renewal:** $50 system fee + state renewal fees
- **Amendments:** $50 system fee

### FRED Filing Process

**1. Create FRED Account:**
Register at NASAA FRED website (franchise attorney typically handles)

**6. Monitor Examiner Comments:**
FRED platform displays deficiency letters from each state

**7. Respond to Comments:**

**8. Receive Effective Dates:**
Each state issues effective date independently (dates may vary)

### FRED vs. Non-FRED States

**Non-FRED Registration States:**
Must file separately through state-specific systems:
- **California:** SMART portal
- **New York:** Mail/email to Investor Protection Bureau
- **Washington:** Mail to Department of Financial Institutions
- **Wisconsin:** Mail to Division of Securities
- **Michigan:** Mail to Attorney General
- **Hawaii:** Mail to Securities Commissioner

**MirrorMe Efficiency:**
