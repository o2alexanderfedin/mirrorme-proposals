## Executive Summary

The franchise agreement is the binding legal contract that governs the relationship between franchisor and franchisee, defining rights, obligations, fees, territory, operational standards, and termination conditions. Unlike the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD), which is a disclosure document, the franchise agreement is a **legally enforceable contract** that both parties sign.

For MirrorMe's franchise system, the franchise agreement must balance franchisor control (to protect brand consistency and quality) with franchisee autonomy (to attract qualified operators). The agreement typically ranges from **50-80 pages** and addresses dozens of complex legal issues including intellectual property licensing, territorial rights, fee structures, performance standards, termination triggers, dispute resolution, and post-termination obligations.

Key structural decisions for MirrorMe:
- **Term:** 10-year initial term with two 5-year renewal options (industry standard)
- **Territory:** Protected territory based on population (75,000-150,000) with performance requirements
- **Fees:** 6-8% royalty, 2-3% national marketing fund, 2-4% local advertising minimum
- **Termination:** Tiered structure with immediate termination for egregious violations, 30-60 day cure periods for remediable breaches
- **Non-Compete:** 2-year post-termination restriction within 15-mile radius (subject to state law limitations)
- **Dispute Resolution:** Mediation-then-arbitration with venue at franchisor's headquarters

The franchise agreement must comply with state franchise relationship laws in 20+ states, requiring state-specific addenda that modify or override certain provisions. Drafting requires experienced franchise attorney; template agreements from non-specialists create significant legal exposure.

## Term and Renewal Provisions

### Initial Term

**Industry Standard:** 10 years

**Rationale:**
- Sufficient time for franchisee to recoup investment and achieve profitability
- Balances franchisee security with franchisor flexibility
- Aligns with typical franchise loan terms (SBA loans often 10 years)
- Long enough to build sustainable business; short enough to allow system evolution

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **10-year initial term** from date of franchise opening (not signing)

**Sample Language:**

> **3.1 Initial Term.** The initial term of this Agreement shall be ten (10) years, commencing on the date the Franchised Business opens for business (the "Opening Date") and expiring on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Opening Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

### Renewal Terms

**Industry Standard:** 1-2 renewal options of 5 years each (20 years total potential)

**Rationale:**
- Rewards successful franchisees with long-term business opportunity
- Incentivizes franchisee investment in business growth
- Retains experienced operators in system
- Allows franchisor to remove non-performing franchisees at term expiration

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **Two 5-year renewal terms** (20 years total maximum)

**Sample Language:**

> **3.2 Renewal Terms.** Franchisee shall have the option to renew this Agreement for two (2) additional terms of five (5) years each, provided that Franchisee satisfies all of the following conditions:
>
> (a) Franchisee provides written notice of intent to renew at least six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months before expiration of the then-current term;
>
> (b) Franchisee is not in default of any provision of this Agreement, and has not been in default two (2) or more times during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding renewal;
>
> (c) Franchisee has substantially complied with all material provisions of this Agreement during the term;
>
> (d) Franchisee executes Franchisor's then-current form of franchise agreement (which may contain materially different terms, including higher royalty rates and fees);
>
> (e) Franchisee executes a general release of claims against Franchisor;
>
> (f) Franchisee pays the renewal fee specified in Item 6 of the Franchise Disclosure Document then in effect;
>
> (g) Franchisee completes any required upgrading, remodeling, or modernization of the Franchised Business to conform to Franchisor's then-current standards;
>
> (h) Franchisee and its principals complete any required refresher training;
>
> (i) Franchisee presents evidence of current lease with term extending at least through renewal term, or executes new lease acceptable to Franchisor; and
>
> (j) Franchisee's territory meets minimum performance standards specified in Section 4.3.

### Renewal Conditions (Critical Analysis)

**Condition (d) - New Franchise Agreement:**
- **Franchisor Benefit:** Allows updating agreement terms, fees, technology requirements
- **Franchisee Concern:** Could face materially higher royalties or burdensome new requirements
- **State Law Limitations:** Some states restrict franchisor's ability to impose materially different terms
- **Best Practice:** Clearly disclose in FDD that renewal will require current agreement

**Condition (e) - General Release:**
- **Franchisor Benefit:** Releases claims and prevents litigation upon renewal
- **Franchisee Concern:** Waives legal rights for unknown violations
- **State Law Limitations:** Many states void general release requirements as against public policy (e.g., California, Minnesota, Washington)
- **Best Practice:** Include state addendum disclosing that release may be unenforceable

**Condition (g) - Remodeling/Modernization:**
- **Franchisor Benefit:** Ensures brand remains current and competitive
- **Franchisee Concern:** Can require significant capital investment ($20K-$100K+)
- **Best Practice:** Disclose in FDD that remodeling may be required; provide reasonable notice (12-18 months)

**Condition (j) - Performance Standards:**
- **Franchisor Benefit:** Allows non-renewal of underperforming franchisees
- **Franchisee Concern:** Low sales could result from market conditions beyond control
- **State Law Limitations:** Some states require "good cause" for non-renewal, which may override performance minimums if franchisee made good faith efforts
- **Best Practice:** Set reasonable performance minimums; allow consideration of circumstances

### Renewal Fee

**Industry Standard:** 10-25% of current initial franchise fee

**Typical Range:** $5,000 - $15,000 for service franchises

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **20% of current franchise fee** (approximately $7,000-$10,000 if initial fee is $35,000-$50,000)

**Rationale:**
- Covers franchisor's administrative costs (FDD review, training, lease review)
- Lower than initial fee (franchisee already trained and established)
- Generates revenue without excessive burden

**Sample Language:**

> **3.3 Renewal Fee.** Upon renewal, Franchisee shall pay Franchisor a renewal fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of the then-current initial franchise fee disclosed in Franchisor's Franchise Disclosure Document.

---

## Territory Provisions

### Territory Definition

**Options:**
1. **Geographic boundaries** (zip codes, city limits, county lines)
2. **Radius from studio location** (5, 10, 15 miles)
3. **Population-based territory** (minimum 75,000-150,000 population)
4. **Combination** (radius within demographic requirements)

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **Population-based territories** with geographic boundaries

**Sample Language:**

> **4.1 Territory.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Franchisor grants Franchisee the right to operate the Franchised Business within the territory described in Exhibit A (the "Territory"). The Territory shall be defined by specific zip codes, boundaries, or other geographic demarcations and shall contain a minimum population of [75,000 to 150,000] based on the most recent U.S. Census data.

### Exclusivity vs. Non-Exclusivity

**Exclusive Territory:**
Franchisor will not establish or franchise another MirrorMe location within franchisee's territory.

**Non-Exclusive Territory:**
Franchisor reserves right to establish company-owned or franchised locations anywhere, including within franchisee's territory.

**Protected Territory (Hybrid - Recommended):**
Franchisor will not establish or franchise competing location within territory **if franchisee meets performance standards**.

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **Protected territory with performance requirements**

**Sample Language:**

> **4.2 Territorial Protection.** Subject to Franchisee's compliance with Section 4.3 (Performance Standards), Franchisor will not establish or franchise another MirrorMe studio within the Territory during the term of this Agreement. This protection does not apply to:
>
> (a) Non-traditional locations (airports, hotels, convention centers, government facilities);
>
> (b) Alternative distribution channels (online marketplace, e-commerce platform);
>
> (c) National or corporate accounts serviced from any location;
>
> (d) Acquisitions of businesses operating within the Territory prior to acquisition; or
>
> (e) Other brands owned or operated by Franchisor that do not use the MirrorMe Marks.

### Performance Requirements

**Purpose:** Maintain territory protection only if franchisee actively develops market and achieves minimum revenue thresholds.

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **Graduated performance minimums** over first 3 years

**Sample Language:**

> **4.3 Performance Standards.** To maintain territorial protection under Section 4.2, Franchisee must achieve the following minimum annual Gross Revenues:
>
> | Year | Minimum Annual Gross Revenue |
> |------|------------------------------|
> | Year 1 | $100,000 |
> | Year 2 | $175,000 |
> | Year 3 and thereafter | $250,000 |
>
> If Franchisee fails to meet the minimum revenue for any year, Franchisor may, in its discretion:
>
> (a) Reduce the size of the Territory;
>
> (b) Establish or franchise additional MirrorMe locations within the Territory;
>
> (c) Require Franchisee to develop a performance improvement plan; or
>
> (d) Take no action and continue territorial protection.
>
> Failure to meet performance standards does not constitute a default or grounds for termination but may result in loss of territorial exclusivity.

### Franchisor Reserved Rights (Within Territory)

**Critical Provision:** Even with "exclusive" territory, franchisor must reserve certain rights to operate flexibly.

**Sample Language:**

> **4.4 Reserved Rights.** Notwithstanding the territorial protection in Section 4.2, Franchisor expressly reserves the following rights within the Territory:
>
> **(a) National and Corporate Accounts.** Franchisor may establish relationships with national or regional corporate clients and service those accounts from any location, including within the Territory. Franchisor may pay Franchisee a referral fee for local servicing of such accounts, but Franchisee has no exclusive right to service national accounts located in the Territory.
>
> **(b) Alternative Channels.** Franchisor may offer MirrorMe services through alternative distribution channels, including but not limited to: online platforms, mobile applications, partnerships with corporate clients, co-branded arrangements, and third-party marketplaces.
>
> **(c) Non-Traditional Locations.** Franchisor may establish or franchise MirrorMe studios at non-traditional locations such as airports, hotels, convention centers, corporate campuses, government facilities, universities, hospitals, and military installations.
>
> **(d) Acquisitions.** Franchisor may acquire or be acquired by other businesses, and such businesses may continue to operate within the Territory under different brands or under the MirrorMe brand if Franchisor determines integration is appropriate.
>
> **(e) Relocation Rights.** If Franchisee relocates the Franchised Business outside the Territory, Franchisee forfeits territorial protection and Franchisor may establish or franchise another location within the original Territory.

### Territory Continuation Upon Renewal

**Sample Language:**

> **4.5 Territory Upon Renewal.** Upon renewal of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.2, Franchisee's Territory may be modified based on:
>
> (a) Changes in population, demographics, or market conditions;
>
> (b) Franchisee's performance during the preceding term;
>
> (c) Development of additional franchises in adjacent territories; or
>
> (d) Changes in Franchisor's territory allocation policies.
>
> Franchisor will provide written notice of any proposed territory modification at least ninety (90) days before the renewal effective date. If Franchisee objects to the modification, Franchisee may elect not to renew the Agreement.

## Fee Structure Provisions

### Initial Franchise Fee

**Industry Standard:** $25,000 - $75,000 for service franchises

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** $35,000 - $50,000 (mid-range positioning)

**Sample Language:**

> **5.1 Initial Franchise Fee.** Upon execution of this Agreement, Franchisee shall pay Franchisor a non-refundable initial franchise fee of [insert amount] as disclosed in Item 5 of the Franchise Disclosure Document. The initial franchise fee compensates Franchisor for the right to enter the franchise system, use the Marks, access the proprietary System, and receive initial training and pre-opening support.
>
> The initial franchise fee is fully earned by Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement and is non-refundable under any circumstances, including termination of this Agreement or Franchisee's failure to open the Franchised Business.

**Non-Refundability:** Courts consistently uphold non-refundable franchise fee provisions. Clearly state in both agreement and FDD (Item 5).

### Royalty Fee

**Industry Standard:** 4-10% of gross revenue for service franchises

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **6-8% of Gross Revenue**

**Rationale:**
- Corporate photography is premium service (supports higher royalty than commodity services)
- Technology platform costs justify ongoing fee
- Competitive with similar service franchises (portrait studios: 6-8%, business services: 5-9%)

**Gross Revenue Definition (Critical):**

> **5.2 Royalty Fee.** Beginning on the Opening Date, Franchisee shall pay Franchisor a continuing royalty (the "Royalty Fee") equal to [6-8]% of Gross Revenue, payable monthly on or before the tenth (10th) day of each month for the preceding month.
>
> **5.3 Definition of Gross Revenue.** "Gross Revenue" means all revenues and receipts of every kind and nature derived from or in connection with the operation of the Franchised Business, including but not limited to:
>
> (a) Photography session fees and sitting fees;
>
> (b) Print sales, digital image sales, and all product sales;
>
> (c) Event photography fees and corporate contracts;
>
> (d) Retouching, editing, and post-production services;
>
> (e) Training or consultation services provided to clients;
>
> (f) Payments received for services performed even if billed later;
>
> (g) Credit card, gift card, and promotional voucher redemptions (at full face value);
>
> (h) Barter or trade transactions (at fair market value);
>
> (i) Insurance proceeds for business interruption; and
>
> (j) All other revenue regardless of source.
>
> **Exclusions from Gross Revenue:**
>
> Gross Revenue excludes only:
>
> (a) Sales taxes, use taxes, and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to tax authorities;
>
> (b) Customer refunds actually paid (not discounts or adjustments); and
>
> (c) [No other exclusions - comprehensive definition].
>
> **Burden of Proof.** Franchisee bears the burden of proving any claimed exclusion from Gross Revenue. If Franchisee cannot substantiate an exclusion, the full amount shall be included in Gross Revenue.

**Why Comprehensive Definition Matters:**
- Franchisees may attempt to categorize revenue as "non-royalty-bearing" (e.g., "shipping fees," "administrative fees")
- Broad definition with limited exclusions prevents revenue manipulation
- Courts uphold comprehensive gross revenue definitions

### Marketing Fund Contribution

**Industry Standard:** 1-4% of gross revenue

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **2-3% of Gross Revenue**

**Sample Language:**

> **5.4 Marketing Fund Contribution.** Franchisee shall contribute [2-3]% of Gross Revenue to Franchisor's National Marketing Fund (the "Marketing Fund"), payable monthly with the Royalty Fee. The Marketing Fund will be used for:
>
> (a) National and regional brand advertising campaigns;
>
> (b) Digital marketing, SEO, and social media advertising;
>
> (c) Public relations and media outreach;
>
> (d) Marketing materials, templates, and campaign development;
>
> (e) Lead generation programs and franchise system promotion;
>
> (f) Market research and brand development;
>
> (g) Administration of the Marketing Fund (up to 15% of fund); and
>
> (h) Any other marketing or promotional activities Franchisor deems appropriate.
>
> **5.5 Marketing Fund Administration.** Franchisor shall administer the Marketing Fund and shall have sole discretion over expenditures, campaigns, and strategies. The Marketing Fund is not a trust and Franchisor may commingle Marketing Fund contributions with other funds. Franchisor will prepare an annual accounting of Marketing Fund expenditures, which will be available to franchisees upon request. Franchisor may, but is not required to, establish an advisory council of franchisees to provide input on Marketing Fund expenditures, but Franchisor retains final decision-making authority.
>
> Franchisor and company-owned studios shall contribute to the Marketing Fund on the same basis as franchisees.

**Advisory Council (Optional but Recommended):**
- Builds franchisee trust and buy-in
- Provides market feedback on campaign effectiveness
- Does not relinquish franchisor control

### Local Advertising Requirement

**Industry Standard:** 1-4% of gross revenue (in addition to Marketing Fund)

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **Minimum 2-4% of Gross Revenue spent locally**

**Sample Language:**

> **5.6 Local Advertising Requirement.** Franchisee shall spend a minimum of [2-4]% of Gross Revenue each month on local advertising and marketing in the Territory. Qualifying expenditures include:
>
> (a) Local digital advertising (Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.);
>
> (b) Print advertising in local publications;
>
> (c) Direct mail and email marketing campaigns;
>
> (d) Sponsorship of local events and organizations;
>
> (e) Promotional materials and signage;
>
> (f) Networking events and business development activities; and
>
> (g) Other advertising approved by Franchisor.
>
> All local advertising must comply with Franchisor's brand standards and must be submitted for approval before use. Franchisee shall maintain records of local advertising expenditures and submit monthly reports documenting compliance.

### Technology and Platform Fees

**MirrorMe Requirement:** Access to proprietary AI photography platform

**Recommendation:** **$200-$500 per month** (separate from royalty)

**Sample Language:**

> **5.7 Technology Platform Fee.** Franchisee shall pay Franchisor a monthly technology platform fee of [insert amount] for access to the MirrorMe AI photography platform, customer relationship management system, scheduling software, and related technology services. The technology fee is due on the first day of each month and is in addition to the Royalty Fee and Marketing Fund contribution.
>
> Franchisor may increase the technology platform fee annually upon sixty (60) days' written notice to reflect increased costs, technology upgrades, or expanded services.

### Other Fees

**Sample Table (from FDD Item 6):**

| Fee Type | Amount | When Due |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Transfer Fee | 50% of then-current initial franchise fee | Upon transfer to third party |
| Renewal Fee | 20% of then-current initial franchise fee | Upon each renewal |
| Additional Training | $1,500-$3,000 per person | Before training |
| Late Payment Fee | 1.5% per month (18% annual) or maximum legal rate | Past due amounts |
| Insufficient Funds Fee | $100 per occurrence | Upon NSF or rejected payment |

---

## Termination and Default Provisions

### Immediate Termination (No Cure Period)

**Rationale:** Certain violations are so egregious that franchisor must be able to terminate immediately.

**Sample Language:**

>
> **(k) Government Action.** Has the Franchised Business closed or operations suspended by government authority for health, safety, or legal violations.

### Termination with Cure Period

**Rationale:** For remediable breaches, franchisee should have opportunity to cure before termination.

**Sample Language:**

> **15.2 Termination Upon Notice and Cure Period.** Franchisor may terminate this Agreement if Franchisee fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or the Operations Manual and does not cure the default within the time specified below after written notice from Franchisor:
>

### Notice Requirements

>
> (b) Describe the facts constituting the breach;
>
> (c) Specify the time period for curing the default, if applicable; and
>
> (d) State the consequences if the default is not cured.

### State Law Modifications

**Important:** Many states require "good cause" for termination and minimum notice periods longer than specified in agreement.

**Sample Language (State Addendum):**

> **MINNESOTA ADDENDUM**
>
> Notwithstanding Section 15 of the Franchise Agreement, Minnesota law requires that Franchisor have "good cause" to terminate this Agreement and provide the following minimum notice periods:
>
> - **Termination:** Ninety (90) days' written notice
> - **Non-Renewal:** One hundred eighty (180) days' written notice before expiration
>
> "Good cause" under Minnesota law includes, but is not limited to, material breach of the franchise agreement, failure to pay fees, failure to comply with quality standards after notice and opportunity to cure, or abandonment of the franchise.

## Transfer and Assignment Restrictions

### Prohibition on Unauthorized Transfer

> **(e) Training.** Proposed transferee must successfully complete Franchisor's initial training program at transferee's expense;
>
> **(f) Current Agreement.** Proposed transferee must execute Franchisor's then-current form of franchise agreement (which may contain materially different terms than this Agreement) for the remainder of Franchisee's term or for a new term as Franchisor may specify;
>
> **(g) General Release.** Franchisee and all owners of Franchisee must execute a general release of all claims against Franchisor (except in states where prohibited by law);
>
> **(h) Lease Assignment.** If premises are leased, landlord must consent to lease assignment or proposed transferee must negotiate a new acceptable lease;
>
> **(i) Payment of Amounts Due.** Franchisee must pay all amounts due to Franchisor, suppliers, and other creditors;
>
> **(j) Confidentiality Agreement.** Franchisee must execute a continuing confidentiality agreement regarding proprietary information;
>
> **(k) Non-Compete.** Franchisee must execute a non-compete agreement covering the period specified in Section 16.2; and
>

>
> Franchisor may withhold consent to a proposed transfer if any of the above conditions is not satisfied. Franchisor will not unreasonably withhold consent if all conditions are met.

### Death or Disability Transfer

**Sample Language:**

> **14.3 Transfer Upon Death or Disability.** If Franchisee (or a principal owner of Franchisee entity) dies or becomes permanently disabled, the franchise may be transferred to the deceased or disabled person's heir, estate representative, or designated successor, subject to the following:
>
> (a) **Interim Management.** Within thirty (30) days of death or disability, the estate or family must appoint an interim manager acceptable to Franchisor who has completed Franchisor's training program or agrees to complete training within sixty (60) days;
>
> (b) **Transfer Deadline.** The estate or successor must complete transfer of the franchise to a qualified transferee within twelve (12) months of death or disability;
>
> (c) **Transfer Requirements.** Transfer must satisfy all requirements of Section 14.2, except that:
>    - Transfer fee may be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%) of current initial franchise fee (family discount); and
>    - General release may be waived at Franchisor's discretion; and
>
> (d) **Franchisor Assistance.** Franchisor will reasonably cooperate with the estate or family to facilitate transfer, but Franchisor is not obligated to accept a transferee who does not meet qualification standards.

### Franchisor's Right to Purchase (Right of First Refusal)

**Optional Provision:** Gives franchisor option to purchase franchise instead of approving third-party transfer.

**Sample Language:**

> **14.4 Right of First Refusal.** If Franchisee receives a bona fide offer from a third party to purchase the franchise or the Franchised Business, and Franchisee desires to accept such offer, Franchisee shall notify Franchisor in writing and provide a copy of the offer. Franchisor shall have thirty (30) days to elect to purchase the franchise on the same terms and conditions offered by the third party, except that:
>
> (a) Franchisor may substitute cash for any non-cash consideration;
>
> (b) Franchisor shall have an additional ninety (90) days to close the transaction after exercising the right of first refusal; and
>
> (c) Franchisor shall not assume any liabilities except those expressly agreed to in writing.
>
> If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal, Franchisee may proceed with the third-party sale subject to compliance with Section 14.2.

## Post-Termination Obligations

### De-Identification Requirements

**Sample Language:**

> **16.1 De-Identification.** Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Franchisee shall immediately:
>
> **(a) Signage and Marks.** Remove all signs, trade dress, and other materials displaying the Marks from the Franchised Business location, vehicles, websites, social media, advertising, and all other locations. Franchisee shall provide photographic evidence of removal within ten (10) days of termination;
>
> **(b) Telephone and Directory Listings.** Cancel or transfer to Franchisor all telephone numbers, directory listings, email addresses, domain names, social media accounts, and other identifiers associated with the Marks;
>
> **(c) Supplies and Materials.** Destroy or return to Franchisor all proprietary materials, including Operations Manual, training materials, customer lists, marketing materials, and any other confidential information or materials bearing the Marks;
>
> **(d) Websites and Online Presence.** Immediately disable, redirect, or transfer to Franchisor all websites, social media pages, online directories, and digital advertising associated with the Franchised Business or the Marks;
>
> **(e) Assumed Names.** Cancel all assumed name or DBA filings that include the Marks or any confusingly similar names;
>
> **(f) Notification.** Notify all customers, suppliers, and business contacts that Franchisee is no longer affiliated with Franchisor or authorized to use the Marks; and
>
> **(g) Conversion.** If Franchisee continues to operate a photography business at the same or nearby location, Franchisee shall modify the business to eliminate any association with the Marks or the System, including different name, branding, color scheme, and trade dress.

### Post-Term Non-Compete Covenant

**Purpose:** Prevent franchisee from using confidential information and training to compete immediately after termination.

**Legal Limitations:**
- Must be reasonable in time, geography, and scope
- Some states void or severely restrict non-competes (California, North Dakota, Oklahoma)
- Courts scrutinize non-competes; overly broad provisions are unenforceable

**Industry Standard:**
- **Duration:** 1-3 years (2 years most common)
- **Geography:** Radius from former location (5-25 miles) or former territory
- **Scope:** Same or similar services using similar methods

**MirrorMe Recommendation:** **2 years, 15-mile radius, corporate photography services**

**Sample Language:**

> **16.2 Covenant Not to Compete.** For a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Franchisee and all owners of Franchisee entity shall not, directly or indirectly:
>
> **(a) Own, operate, manage, engage in, be employed by, provide services to, or have any financial interest in any business that offers corporate headshot photography, business portrait photography, or substantially similar services to those offered by MirrorMe studios;
>
> **(b) Within a radius of fifteen (15) miles from the former Franchised Business location or within the Territory (whichever is greater); or
>
> **(c) Solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of the Franchised Business or any customer of any other MirrorMe franchise to purchase photography services from a competing business.
>
> This covenant shall not prohibit:
>
> (i) Ownership of less than five percent (5%) passive investment in a publicly traded company;
>
> (ii) Employment in a non-competitive role (e.g., administrative, accounting, unrelated business functions); or
>
> (iii) Operation of a non-competing photography business (e.g., wedding photography, family portraits, product photography) that does not offer corporate headshot services.
>
> Franchisee acknowledges that this covenant is reasonable in time, geography, and scope, and is necessary to protect Franchisor's legitimate business interests in confidential information, trade secrets, and goodwill. If any portion of this covenant is deemed unenforceable, the parties agree that the court may modify the provision to make it enforceable (blue-pencil doctrine).

**State Addenda Required:**
- **California:** Post-term non-competes generally unenforceable except for sale of business
- **North Dakota:** Non-competes prohibited by state constitution
- **Other states:** May limit duration, geography, or scope

**Sample California Addendum:**

> **CALIFORNIA ADDENDUM - NON-COMPETE**
>
> Notwithstanding Section 16.2 of the Franchise Agreement, California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 prohibits post-termination non-compete covenants except in connection with the sale of a business. Section 16.2 shall apply only to the extent permitted under California law. Upon termination of this Agreement, Franchisee shall remain subject to confidentiality obligations under Section 9, prohibition on use of Marks under Section 10, and other obligations that do not constitute an unreasonable restraint on Franchisee's ability to engage in lawful business or profession.

### Continuing Obligations

**Sample Language:**

> **16.3 Continuing Obligations.** The following obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement:
>
> (a) Payment of all amounts due to Franchisor;
>
> (b) Confidentiality and trade secret protection (Section 9);
>
> (c) Prohibition on use of Marks (Section 10);
>
> (d) De-identification requirements (Section 16.1);
>
> (e) Covenant not to compete (Section 16.2);
>
> (f) Indemnification obligations (Section 18);
>
> (g) Dispute resolution provisions (Section 19); and
>
> (h) Any other provisions that by their nature should survive.

---

## Dispute Resolution Provisions

### Mediation Requirement

**Purpose:** Encourage resolution of disputes without litigation expense.

**Sample Language:**

> **19.1 Mediation.** Except for claims seeking injunctive relief (e.g., trademark infringement, breach of confidentiality, violation of non-compete), before either party may initiate arbitration or litigation, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation. Either party may initiate mediation by providing written notice to the other party. Within thirty (30) days of the mediation notice, the parties shall:
>
> (a) Select a mutually acceptable mediator (or request appointment from the American Arbitration Association if parties cannot agree);
>
> (b) Share a summary of the dispute and desired resolution;
>
> (c) Participate in at least one mediation session of at least four (4) hours; and
>
> (d) Negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute.
>
> Mediation costs (mediator fees and administrative fees) shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall bear its own attorney fees and expenses. Mediation shall be confidential, and no statements made during mediation may be used as evidence in subsequent proceedings.
>
> If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the mediation notice, either party may proceed to arbitration or litigation as provided in Sections 19.2 and 19.3.

### Arbitration Provisions

**Option 1: Binding Arbitration (Recommended)**

**Advantages:**
- Faster and less expensive than litigation
- Private (not public record)
- Arbitrator expertise in franchising
- Limited appeal rights (finality)

**Disadvantages:**
- Franchisee may prefer jury trial
- Some states limit arbitration requirements
- Discovery more limited than litigation

**Sample Language:**

> **19.2 Binding Arbitration.** Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the franchise relationship that is not resolved through mediation under Section 19.1 shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Section.
>
> **(a) Arbitrator Selection.** For claims less than $100,000, one (1) arbitrator shall be appointed by AAA. For claims of $100,000 or more, three (3) arbitrators shall be appointed, with each party selecting one arbitrator and the two party-selected arbitrators selecting the third.
>
> **(b) Location.** Arbitration shall take place in [Franchisor's headquarters city and state], unless the parties agree otherwise or state law requires arbitration in franchisee's state.
>
> **(c) Arbitrator Authority.** The arbitrator(s) shall have authority to award any relief that would be available in court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, specific performance, and declaratory relief. The arbitrator(s) shall apply the substantive law specified in Section 19.4.
>
> **(d) No Class Actions.** All disputes shall be resolved on an individual basis. Franchisee waives any right to participate in a class action, collective action, or representative proceeding. Each dispute shall be arbitrated separately (except that Franchisor may consolidate claims against multiple franchisees arising from the same facts).
>
> **(e) Costs and Fees.** Each party shall pay its own attorney fees and costs, unless the arbitrator awards fees to the prevailing party as permitted by applicable law. Arbitrator fees and AAA administrative fees shall be split equally unless the arbitrator allocates costs differently based on the outcome.
>
> **(f) Judgment.** The arbitration award may be confirmed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**State Law Considerations:**
- California may require arbitration in franchisee's state
- Some states prohibit class action waivers
- Washington and other states may require fee-shifting to prevailing franchisee

**Option 2: Litigation (Alternative)**

If franchisor prefers litigation over arbitration:

> **19.2 Litigation.** Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the franchise relationship that is not resolved through mediation under Section 19.1 shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [County], [State]. Franchisee irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection based on inconvenient forum.

### Governing Law

**Sample Language:**

> **19.4 Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Franchisor's State], without regard to conflicts of law principles, except to the extent that federal law or the law of the state in which the Franchised Business is located applies to franchise relationships.
>
> If this Agreement or any provision hereof is inconsistent with or conflicts with any applicable state franchise relationship law, then such state law shall control to the extent of the inconsistency, but all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

**Note:** State franchise relationship laws typically override choice of law provisions for substantive relationship matters (termination, renewal, transfers) but not for contract interpretation or other issues.

### Injunctive Relief

**Sample Language:**

> **19.3 Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding Section 19.1 and 19.2, either party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent:
>
> (a) Unauthorized use of the Marks or confidential information;
>
> (b) Violation of the covenant not to compete;
>
> (c) Disclosure of trade secrets;
>
> (d) Imminent harm to health, safety, or brand reputation; or
>
> (e) Any other irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate.
>
> The parties acknowledge that irreparable harm would result from such violations and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy.

### Attorney Fees and Costs

**Options:**
1. **Each party pays own fees** (neutral)
2. **Prevailing party recovers fees** (discourages frivolous claims)
3. **Franchisee recovers fees if prevails; franchisor does not** (some state laws require)

**Sample Language (Prevailing Party):**

> **19.5 Attorney Fees.** In any arbitration, litigation, or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, costs of investigation, and other expenses from the non-prevailing party, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## Conclusion

The franchise agreement is a complex legal document that must balance franchisor brand protection with franchisee operational flexibility. For MirrorMe:

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Term:** 10-year initial term, two 5-year renewals (20 years total)
2. **Territory:** Protected territory with 75,000-150,000 population, performance requirements
3. **Fees:** 6-8% royalty, 2-3% marketing fund, 2-4% local advertising minimum
4. **Termination:** Tiered structure with immediate termination for egregious breaches, 30-60 day cure for remediable defaults
5. **Non-Compete:** 2 years, 15-mile radius (subject to state law modifications)
6. **Dispute Resolution:** Mediation-then-arbitration (or litigation based on preference)
7. **State Addenda:** Required for all relationship law states

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Engage experienced franchise attorney (not general business attorney)
- Ensure consistency between FDD and franchise agreement
- Include state-specific addenda for all relationship law states
- Balance franchisor control with franchisee autonomy to attract quality operators
- Clear, comprehensive language prevents disputes and litigation

A well-drafted franchise agreement protects both parties and establishes foundation for successful long-term relationship.
