## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|

### Kill if:

🛑 **No demand**: <3 corporate clients after 90 days of outreach<br/>
