# Sprint 02: Franchise Development & Multi-Location Expansion

## Opportunity Overview

**Opportunity Title**: MirrorMe Franchise Development Program - Nationwide Expansion

**Sprint ID**: 02

**Date Created**: 2025-11-17

**Status**: Discovery Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Transform MirrorMe from a single San Francisco location into a national franchise brand with 50-100 locations across major U.S. metropolitan areas. The automated photostudio model is highly franchise-ready with proven unit economics, low labor requirements, and scalable technology.

**Market Validation**: The Korean model (Life Four Cuts) has 410+ franchise locations and is rapidly expanding to the U.S., validating massive demand for self-service portrait studios.

**Franchise Economics**: $110K-$165K initial investment, $306K-$428K annual revenue per location, 30-45% net margins for franchisees.

**Competitive Timing**: **URGENT** - Life Four Cuts is actively expanding in 18+ U.S. states via H Mart partnerships. MirrorMe must move quickly to establish brand presence before the Korean giant saturates the market.
